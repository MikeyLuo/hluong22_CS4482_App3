# 2D Space shooter made in Unity
# For my App 3 game that I will be working on independently, I will be creating my own 2D
# version of space shooter. The game will be designed like any regular space shooter game. The
# user will only be allowed to move horizontally via. Keyboard input and will have to
# destroy/avoid incoming enemy aircraft. As the user destroys enemy aircrafts, they will be
# awarded points which will be used to progress onto a new level. Level progression is reached by
# accumulating a certain number of points. The higher the level the more enemies there are, and
# the harder they will be to destroy. There is no defeating the game, it will only record and log
# how long the player lasted and how many points they have accumulated.
